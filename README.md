Marks are stored as symbolic links in the directory $MARKPATH (default $HOME/.marks)


## Installation

With [Oh-My-Fish](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish):

    omf install jump

Without Oh-My-Fish:

    TODO

## Usage

    jump FOO: jump to a mark named FOO
    mark FOO: create a mark named FOO
    unmark FOO: delete a mark
    marks: lists all marks

```
